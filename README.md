## Description
This is a small "Demo Game" made by me for a small course called "Game Programming", all the physics in the game is not matured with a physics engine but realised with the provided code. I decided to upload only the assets used and the source code, so you have to put everything into a JMonkeyEngine SDK project if you want to try it out.
